[00:00.00][Short Intro](Warm Rhodes piano chords, a soft finger snap)(Female voice: "Ooh, mmm, lazy humming...")
[00:21.69][Verse 1 - Rap](Female)I had that fire once, yeah,
[00:24.61]a burning sun in my chest
[00:27.32]Young knight,
[00:28.78]red blood,
[00:30.37]never thought about the rest
[00:32.35]But the world is a winter,
[00:34.20]and people... they're just cold
[00:37.65]Leaving me in the silence, watching the story unfold
[00:43.87]They walked away, and the room got so wide
[00:46.32]But that's when I found the king living inside
[00:49.17]The cold didn't break me, it just made me refined
[00:54.82]I left their noisy world so far behind
[00:57.58]I'm not hiding, I'm just finding my peace
[01:01.14]In the shadows, where the heart finds release
[01:04.90][Chorus - Melodic & Groovy](Female)I built my Castlevania, high above the rain
[01:09.69]Found the beauty in the quiet, found the power in the pain
[01:15.51]I’m the King of the Night,
[01:17.93]lounging on my own throne
[01:20.67]In this velvet darkness,
[01:22.82]I’m never alone
[01:26.20]Yeah, I'm the King... my own King.
[01:30.01]King of the night, mmm...
[01:36.11][music]
[01:38.71][Verse 2 - Rap](Male)No more chasing shadows, no more begging for a light
[01:41.41]I’m the one who sets the mood, I’m the owner of the night
[01:43.93]Self-reconciliation, yeah, we’re vibing, me and me
[01:46.78]In this castle of my mind, I’m finally free
[01:49.72]People’s indifference?
[01:51.14]That was just a gift
[01:52.43]To let my spirit drift,
[01:53.82]to let the heavy fog lift
[01:55.26]Brick by brick.
[01:56.50]Stone by stone.
[01:57.92]A kingdom for the soul.
[01:59.25]No crown of gold, just a heart that’s whole.
[02:02.82][Chorus - Melodic & Groovy](Female)I built my Castlevania, high above the rain
[02:07.61]Found the beauty in the quiet, found the power in the pain
[02:13.68]I’m the King of the Night,
[02:15.77]lounging on my own throne
[02:18.56]In this velvet darkness, I’m never alone
[02:25.65][Outro](Music strips back, just the bass and piano)(Female lazy humming fades out)(Male whisper: "My night. My way.")
